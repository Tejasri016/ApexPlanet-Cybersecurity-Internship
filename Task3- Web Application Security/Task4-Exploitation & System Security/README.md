# 🔐 TASK 4 – Advanced Web Application Exploitation using DVWA

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates exploitation of common web application vulnerabilities using **Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA)** in a controlled lab environment.

The objective of this task was to understand insecure coding practices, exploitation techniques, and defensive mitigation strategies.

> ⚠️ All testing was performed in a controlled local lab environment using Kali Linux for educational purposes only.

## 🛠 Lab Environment

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux  
- **Web Server:** Apache2  
- **Application:** DVWA  
- **Browser:** Firefox  
- **Testing Tool:** Burp Suite  
- **Security Levels Tested:** Low, Medium, High, Impossible  

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Exploit DVWA vulnerabilities  
- Analyze behavior across security levels  
- Perform web application attacks safely  
- Understand mitigation techniques  
- Compare offensive vs defensive security

# 🔍 Vulnerabilities Tested

---

## 1️⃣ SQL Injection

✅ Result

Retrieved multiple user records

Demonstrated authentication bypass

🔐 Impact

Sensitive data exposure

Authentication bypass risk

🛡 Mitigation

Use prepared statements

Parameterized queries

Input validation

Web Application Firewall (WAF)

2️⃣ Command Injection
🔎 Payload Used
127.0.0.1; whoami
✅ Result

Executed system command on server

Displayed web server user (www-data)

🔐 Impact

Remote Command Execution (RCE)

Full server compromise risk

🛡 Mitigation

Sanitize user inputs

Avoid direct system() usage

Implement strict server-side validation

3️⃣ Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
🔎 Payload Used
<script>alert("XSS")</script>
✅ Result

JavaScript executed in browser

Demonstrated Stored and Reflected XSS

🔐 Impact

Session hijacking

Cookie theft

Phishing attacks

🛡 Mitigation

Output encoding

Input validation

Content Security Policy (CSP)

## 4️⃣ File Upload Vulnerability
🔎 Malicious File Created
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
## ✅ Execution

http://localhost/dvwa/hackable/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami

## ✅ Result

Server executed command

Returned: www-data

## 🔐 Impact

Remote Command Execution

Server takeover risk

---- 

## 🛡 Mitigation

Restrict file extensions (whitelist)

Disable PHP execution in upload directory

Validate MIME types

Rename uploaded files

----

## 5️⃣ Brute Force Attack
# 🔎 Tested Credentials
Username: admin
Password: password

---

# ✅ Observation

Low level: No rate limiting

High level: CAPTCHA protection added

# 🛡 Mitigation

Account lockout policies

CAPTCHA implementation

Rate limiting

Strong password policies

## 6️⃣ CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
# 🔎 Observation

Low level: No token validation

High level: CSRF token implemented

## 🔐 Impact

Unauthorized password changes

Forced user actions

## 🛡 Mitigation

CSRF tokens

SameSite cookies

Session validation

## 🔐 Security Level Comparison
Level	Behavior
Low	No validation
Medium	Basic filtering
High	Stronger validation
Impossible	Secure implementation
## 📊 Key Learning Outcomes

Practical understanding of web vulnerabilities

Hands-on exploitation techniques

Importance of secure coding practices

Security level impact analysis

Defensive mitigation strategies

## 📁 Project Deliverables

Exploitation screenshots

Vulnerability analysis

Security comparison

Mitigation documentation

Video walkthrough

## 🏁 Conclusion

This task demonstrated how improper input validation and insecure coding practices can lead to severe web application vulnerabilities.

By testing across multiple security levels, the importance of defensive security mechanisms was clearly observed.

This lab strengthened both offensive and defensive cybersecurity knowledge.
